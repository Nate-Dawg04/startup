### Elevator pitch

Frustrated with switching between Learning Suite, Canvas, and a thousand other platforms for school assignments? Tired of losing track of your new years resolutions? Wouldn't it be great if there was just a single place to keep track of everything... if only... but wait! Look no farther than **Procrastinot**, an all new platform designed to let you focus on what matters most: the homework itself, your goals, and your gospel study! Find all you homework assignments in one place, keep track of and review your personal goals, and create a personalized gospel study plan for the week.  

### Design

Here's a few pictures demonstrating a basic design as well as some of the features:

### Key features

- Secure login to access your personal dashboard
- All homework assignments displayed in one place and ranked by priority
- Task manager for any other non-school related tasks
- Personal goals tracker with progress indicators
- Customizable gospel study plan on a week by week basis
- Suggested goals from ChatGPT

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML** - Give the structure of the entire application. Multiple HTML pages, including one for login, one for the main dashboard, another for tracking goals, and another for gospel study plans. 
- **CSS** - Provide style to the website with a good color scheme, fonts, and use of whitespace. 
- **React** - Display assignment status including the due date and submission status. Allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks and goals. Shows progress towards goals and gospel study plan. 
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for the following:
    - Retrieving assignments and updating their status
    - Login and logout functionality
    - Suggest goals using ChatGPT API
    - Send notifications for upcoming assignments and tasks
- **DB/Login** - Store login credentials securely. Store personalized user data including their assignments, goals and progress towards them, and their gospel study plan. 
- **WebSocket** - New assignments or adjusted due dates are updated immediately on the webpage. _Possibly (time permitting) display grades of assignments as they are graded._
